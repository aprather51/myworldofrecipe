![project_cover](./project_cover.jpg)

## [DEMO](https://aprather51.github.io/myworldofrecipe/)

My last mintues personal, learning and experimental project using async/await/fetch method to fetch API key from [food2fork](https://www.food2fork.com). Since I need to gain new knowledge about async/await/fetch and compare with Axios and Promise. _Since I don't really pay enough attention on UI/UX, Disregard on my poor UI/UX design_

## Features
- This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) 2.0. 
- Layout were designed simple and quick using sass/css based grid and flex (no css bootstrap). 
- React-router-dom is being used.
